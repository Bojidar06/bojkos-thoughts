#### Okey, I've got some questions that I really need the answers to...  

When you smoke, the goal is to get the effect of smoking, right? That lightheaded buzz feeling is the reason to want to smoke. I saw some people that don't inhale the smoke. After they hit the cigarette they just exhale the smoke.   
Like, why smoke if you won't inhale. It's like drinking alcohol, but not actually drinking it, just getting it in your mount, juggle it a bit in your mount and then spilling it. I don't know, this makes no sense to me. If you smoke, then inhale, otherwise, it's just meaningless.   <br>

Why are there so many different types of cigarettes too? There are literally so many different brands, like what the fuck is the difference. Is it just the look of the cigarette? Cause I mean there are all just tobacco, they gotta be the same, right? For example, I've smoked Karelia Blue, Sobranie Red and a rolled one. What's the difference. The Sobranie one looked a bit different and was definitely really pretty, but about taste, I don't know.
