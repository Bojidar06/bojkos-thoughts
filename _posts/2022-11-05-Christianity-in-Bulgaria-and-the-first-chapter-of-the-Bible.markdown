__Christianity__ is something people in Bulgaria take for granted. Most people say they are __christians__ but they know nothing about _the Bible_, about Jesus, they do [sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin), they only go to church when someone on the television says that today is a type of holiday when you go to church...
The only prayer they do is when they light up a candle in the church. They light it up, close their eyes and say:  
>"God give me this and give me that, please please"...    

That's really absurd  and I really hated that. And yeah, I just described myself, that has been me for the past 15 years of my life. I have always been very interested in Philosophy of life, how does the universe work, death, the human brain... But I never though about reading the Bible.  
If we ask our best friend Google "Why do Christians read the Bible?" we get this:

>"The Bible is used by Christians to give them guidance about how they can live their their lives in the way God would want them to. There is guidance in the Bible on many areas of life and Christians will turn to this advice when they are faced with a dilemma. Some Christians may use a lectionary."

So today, dear readers and radio listeners, we're going to start reading the Bible and to be exact, the first chapter of the first book of the Bible which describes how the Earch is made (according to the author of this chapter).  
The *creation of Everything* or *the Beggining* is an ethernal discussion. I feel like this is alike Politics and inner information - You shouldn't know it.  
So if someone publishes this information to the public, he gets killed because of snitching.  
So if a human beeing founds out how any of this world we live in works, the human race will be stop existing and the living creatures will be restarted, just like the dinosaurs.   
*Maybe there really are things you just shouldn't know.*
