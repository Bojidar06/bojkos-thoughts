# What is time? Why does time pass fasted on other Planets then the Earth. How did the universe begin?

Lets ask google for example if time is the same everywhere?
Answer:
*A clock in outer space moves more quickly than a clock on Earth.*

So no! The is not absolute! So time is the next big illusion. 
What is space though? Why does it do? 

Some people say that space is infinite area. 

**The sun**. The king of all planets in our system. All planets circle around it. Just try to imagine the *speed of light*. Crazy right! Earth's distance from the Sun is 150million kilometers.

Imagine how uselesss we human gotta be. There are 8 billion people on the Earth. And we worry about some stupid problems and think that everything that's happening in our life is important.

Why do people think they are this important. You guys really think human nature and all the animals on the earth are the only living creatures in the whole universe! Of course not.


I really like what Elon Must said in one interview when the interviewer asked him if he believe in God.

```
Interviewer: Do you belive in God?
Elon: I believe there is some explanation 
behind our exiting which you might call God.
```

Many people are so scared of the fact that there might be aliens while aliens could probably be our "God".

SPACE REALLY DOES WORK DIFFERENT FROM THE EARTH!
