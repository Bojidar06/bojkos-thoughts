It's been more than a month since I made my **first investments in stocks and crypto**.  

The platform I chose is *Etoro*. Most people online said that it is the easiest and best platform for beginners to invest. Because at that time I was a **complete beginner**. I still am a beginner, though I have much more knowledge that back then. 

Here are the stocks and cryptos I invested in: 

|  Crypto |Amount| Stocks| Amount
|-------- |------|-------| -------|
| Bitcoin |  50$ |  AMC  |  100$  |
| Ethereum|  50$ |  GME  |  50$   |
| Cardano |  50$ | Apple |  50$   |
|**Total: 400$**|~~~~~~| Tesla | 50$ |

#### That's a total of 400$.
Well, I didn't deposit and invest all the 400$ in the same day. Lets say in a week or so.

As you see, I have the most money in this bullshit AMC. And that was my biggest mistake. **I didn't do my own research and I trusted the *Youtube people.*** Yeah, AMC and GME did great this year. They went up over 1000%. But they cannot go up forever and all those Youtube People knew it. They knew that AMC and GME will cool off a bit but they told their viewers the opposite. Why? - For views.

So I was the idiot who trusted them and I put 150$ in they and yeah... since they their both haven't stopped falling.

Crypto didn't do great at all, too.   
I remember when all my investments were negative and I was at about **70$ loss**.

I don't understand it when people sell a stock at a loss. If you have bought some amount of shares of that stock that you probably believe that it will do good in the future. So it does not make sense for me to sell it the first time it goes down.    


There were many tough times but I never sold anything! 
And now, 1 month later, I have a **30$ profit.**

I am planing on selling **Everything** because I want to invest a lot of money in stocks and crypto.

But I can't do that until I do one successfull withdraw. I need to get all my money out and make sure that it works and then put in more money.

I will wait a bit more beacause I think that crypto will go even higher and then *sell everything and get all my money with a 25-50$ profit.*
