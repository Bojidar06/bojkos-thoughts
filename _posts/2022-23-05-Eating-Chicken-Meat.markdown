Yeah, I have been a vegan/vegetarian for the past like 4 weeks now. But today, I don't want to talk about how eating meat is bad and stuff.  
No. I've been eating meat my whole life. And even though I now have a much different perspective on meat eating because I read a lot about _food and health_, I will not try convince you not to eat meat today.   

Today, dear readers, dear students or whatever, dear hot ladies, I'll inform you a bit more about the money and production side on the **Meat Industry**.

<br>

Did you realize that there's **nine
billion chickens and turkeys sold every
single year and 99.9 percent of them are
factory farmed**.

Okay, they're very very cheap.<br>
The other day I was in the grocery
store with my mom and we were
looking at food and they had these fully
cooked chickens for four dollars.<br>
I'm thinking how can they afford to sell
these because the **grocery store needs a
profit, the distribution center needs a
profit**.<br>
How much do they really invest in
feeding these animals and taking care of
them?  

Now it's really interesting in 1925
it took a hundred twenty-five days to
grow and mature a chicken. Nowadays it
takes 47 days a month and a half to a
full adult chicken.

| Year 1925                                           | 125 days |
| Nowadays: Year 2022                                 | 47 days  |

Okey now <br>
There's a thing called _"CAFOs confined
animal feeding operations"._<br>
This is a part of the factory farming. One organization took one chicken that
was in a factory and tested what's in the chicken and what's in the
feathers and the beak.<br>
In the claws they found **antibiotics**.<br>
So I'm trying to figure out how that got in there.<br>
They also found **arsenic**. Now arsenic is a
poison and arsenic makes the chicken meat look very very pink and it also
acts as an antibiotic. Arsenic is highly
concentrated in the feathers.<br>
The problem is they use the feathers as a feed to feed the chicken so it comes right back.
<br>
The meat industry uses these two chemicals for anxiety because
these poor chickens are so tightly
packed and the way they wake them up is
they give them caffeine.<br>

When you buy meat, most of the times it has a label which states the way the animals are farmed.<br>
There are: <br>
1. natural farm
2. cage-free 
3. free-range 

I won't explain the difference but in simple words, they treat the animals like shit in all the cases.<br>
Its all a bunch of bullshit. Its just another huge business. I mean like there is a reason why its illegal to take pictures and videos in facilities where food animals are raised or slaughtered.<br>
They don't want you to fucking know. Cause if you knew, you probably wouldn't eat meat anymore.
