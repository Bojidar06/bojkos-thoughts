### Remind yourself about the guy in the library and write about him.

The most pure, honest feelings are the most beautiful... 

People are designed to have very strong feelings and emotions like **love and hate**.

People are such beautiful creatures. They are beautiful because they are different. Everyone is so different and its so interestring to see that.

### But now lets talk about this man in the library.

I find it really exiting and interesting to watch someone while h–µ is doing something. Looking at the reactions of someone while he is thinking or reading something is so cool.

This man was reading. He was reading something I think he wrote. He smiled and laughted in a way that you could feel that he is truly liking what he is reading. To see someone truly smiling without caring if they look good or not is incredible.

Overstimulating and Pleasures

The brain is designed to work by hormones whick lead to feelings.
Nowadays there is so much overstimulating that your brain messes up, YOUR WHOLE REWARD SYSTEM GETS FUCKED UP.

When you expose yourself to too much overstimulation you don't enjoy life's basic preasures anymore. You need that massive dopamine release to be happy. If someone gives you flowers or you go to the forest you don't get too amazed.

If you isolate yourself for a week, then when you meet someone and get the change to talk to somebody you will be so happy, because you haven't done this in a while. But if you meet many people every day, then you are not that exited to meet anyone.
