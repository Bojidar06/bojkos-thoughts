Yo buzz cutting my hair was the best decicion ever. Like boys.  

My whole life I've been with medium top short sides type of haircut. I always hated the buzz cut hairstyle cause you know in Burgas it like this stereotype of those guys that are really jacked, wear only adidas and have a buzz cut.  

But fuck that. First of all, one advantage is that you be shaving you own hair, you don't need to go to a hairstylist or whatever. Just buy one cheap hair clipper, watch 1-2 youtube videos and than just shave your head. It's that easy. Second, it's just so comfortable... You don't need to flip your hair so that you doesn't go into your eyes, you don't need to do any work in order for it to look good. And finally, whe you get wet it dries off so fast and easy.  

It's just an amazing hairstyle. Plus it opens your face a lot. Your eyes really pop. This hairstyle it just so easy to maintain. I love it. Guys if you are wondering if you should do a buzz cut or not - DO IT.
