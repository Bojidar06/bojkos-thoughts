I guess I'm in that period where you always what to made changes. You just what to change something in your style, in you behavior or in your room. You need something different.  

Yesterday I did something I was really exited about and I am happy I did it. Even though of course everyone told me not to do it and noone supported the idea.  
I cut my own hair. I mean I just did the hairstyle I always get, but I did it myself. I just took a pair of scissors, my dad's hair clipper and in like two hours I did it just the way I wanted it to me. It actually turned out really good.  

<br> 

#### Lets get now to the actual "Body Modifications" I want :)  

### 1.Tattoo

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="https://www.bodytattooart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112-smasntfg.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5a/48/be/5a48be057a74719a11f4045ebcc21fbe--thigh-tattoos-neck-tattoos.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
  </div>

  </div>

For some reason I really like those neck downwards tattoos of just a word or a sentance. But it's too exposed, too showing. So maybe something more hidden: 

#### I really like viking runes:

<br> 

#### Especially this one:

" style = "margin: auto auto; display: block; width: 50%; border-radius: 100px 100px 10px 10px;">


I just love it. I like it because of it's meaning. I relate to the symbolics and that why.

### 2. Small Earring  

<br> 

I like the look of a small earring just on one ear on a man. Something like that:


<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/47/95/79/479579fb3b83b8ecf0e8fe18df93afe9.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:90%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/5832625/r/il/0f1cbe/1808543353/il_570xN.1808543353_ip3a.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
  </div>

</div>


#### Yeah, that's basically all. And if we combine those with a nice full beard, think it would look real good. I really love beard. That's my number 1 thing I want have. A nice full beard.  

#### I don't feel ready for those mobifications though yet. I feel young. Maybe in a few years, when I feel ready, I'll get them.


<style>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.column {
  float: left;
  width: 49%;
  padding: 5px;
}

/* Clearfix (clear floats) */
.row::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

</style>
