I guess I'm in that period where you always what to made changes. You just what to change something in your style, in you behavior or in your room. You need something different.

Yesterday I did something I was really exited about and I am happy I did it. Even though of course everyone told me not to do it and noone supported the idea.
I cut my own hair. I mean I just did the hairstyle I always get, but I did it myself. I just took a pair of scissors, my dad's hair clipper and in like two hours I did it just the way I wanted it to me. It actually turned out really good.


Lets get now to the actual "Body Modifications" I want :)

I really like viking runes:

Especially this one:


I just love it. I like it because of it's meaning. I relate to the symbolics and that why.

SnowForest
Yeah, that's basically all. And if we combine those with a nice full beard, think it would look real good. I really love beard. That's my number 1 thing I want have. A nice full beard.
I don't feel ready for those mobifications though yet. I feel young. Maybe in a few years, when I feel ready, I'll get them.
