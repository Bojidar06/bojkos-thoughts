I guess I'm in that period where you always what to made changes. You just what to change something in your style, in you behavior or in your room. You need something different.  

Yesterday I did something I was really exited about and I am happy I did it. Even though of course everyone told me not to do it and noone supported the idea.  
I cut my own hair. I mean I just did the hairstyle I always get, but I did it myself. I just took a pair of scissors, my dad's hair clipper and in like two hours I did it just the way I wanted it to me. It actually turned out really good.

#### Lets get now to the actual "Body Modifications" I want :)  

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="https://www.bodytattooart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/112-smasntfg.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">

  </div>

    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/550x/02/12/31/02123190d5523dcf8d5637208a46f901.jpg" alt="Mountains" style="width:60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; border-radius: 40px;">
  </div>
</div>


<style>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.column {
  float: left;
  width: 49.99%;
  padding: 5px;
  border-radius: 40px;
}

/* Clearfix (clear floats) */
.row::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

</style>


For some reason I really like those neck downwards tattoos of just a word or a sentance.
